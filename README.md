## Overview

This project aims to classify customer support requests into distinct intents, which can help organizations respond to common inquiries more efficiently. The model is built using PyTorch, with a Flask web interface for ease of use.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: A deep learning model for classifying intents in customer support messages.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web interface where users can input support queries to see the detected intent.
- **Pre-trained Checkpoints**: Uses trained model checkpoints for faster inference.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for building and training the intent classification model
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the web interface
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and experimentation
- **HTML**: For the web page templates

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abderahmanvt7/intent-detection-in-customer-support-using-llms.git
cd intent-detection-in-customer-support-using-llms
```

2. Download the pre-trained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mDAeiSWxFo_hSf_a4fx3Nggxbx36f0-e/view?usp=drive_link) and place it in the models/ directory. This file will be named model_0.pth by default.

3. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
pipenv shell
```

4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the application

```bash
python src/app.py
```

## Usage

Open the web application and enter a customer support query.

1. Click on "Detect Intent" to see the predicted intent displayed on the page.
2. You can also directly use the predict.py script to classify an intent

```bash
python src/predict.py --input "Your customer support query here"
```

## Results

The model achieves approximately 93% accuracy on the test dataset, effectively classifying intents in customer support messages with high reliability.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

- **Limited Dataset:** The current model is trained on a relatively small dataset, which may limit its performance across diverse customer queries. Increasing the dataset size and diversity could potentially improve its accuracy.
- **Intent Overlap:** Some intents have overlapping language patterns, which may make it challenging for the model to differentiate them accurately.
- **Lack of Context Awareness:** The model processes each query independently, which may limit understanding for queries that rely on previous - interactions or contextual information.

### Future Work

- **Model Improvement:** It is possible to enhance accuracy by exploring other deep learning models or hybrid approaches, such as combining rule-based methods with deep learning.
- **Multi-language Support:** Extending the model to support multiple languages could broaden its applicability for international customer support.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Incorporating context-awareness techniques, like memory networks, may improve the model’s performance in cases where understanding context is essential.
- **Interactive Feedback Loop:** Developing a feedback mechanism that allows users to correct misclassified intents could help refine the model over time, with corrections feeding - back into training data to improve accuracy.
